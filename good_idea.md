Baseline maps: Compile current land-use/land-cover and floral resource layers for the chosen sites.

Run two open models:

InVEST Pollination to map wild-pollinator abundance/suitability before vs. after planting. 
Google Cloud Storage
Natural Capital Project

InVEST Habitat Quality to estimate general biodiversity uplift from the crabapple-guild mosaic.

(If you want bee-colony dynamics, add BEEHAVE/BEE-STEWARD or a simple NetLogo pollination ABM.)

CCL

Scorecard cross-check: Pre/post field scoring with the Xerces/NRCS pollinator scorecards to ground-truth model outputs. 
Xerces Society
eFOTG

Field sensors: 10–20 fixed transects with pan traps, timed bee walks, fruit-drop cameras, and point counts for birds.

Report: Compare indices (pollinator suitability, habitat quality, scorecard totals) across at least two growing seasons to claim “repeated simulations + measurements show X.”

What I’d forecast (directionally) if we execute the guild plan

Spring: Significant increase in early-season forage availability (crabapple bloom + willow catkins) → higher bee activity and brood success nearby. 
Woodland Trust

Autumn–winter: Large, persistent fruit set → more bird-days and small-mammal foraging through freeze-up.
